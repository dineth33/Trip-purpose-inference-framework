1. Taxi trips GPS data (Timestamped Origin and Destination cordinates)  </br> 

2. [Point of Intereset (POI) data](https://github.com/dineth33/Trip-purpose-inference-framework/blob/main/POI_data.csv) </br> 

3. [Road Network data](https://github.com/dineth33/Trip-purpose-inference-framework/tree/main/Road%20network) </br> 

4. [Land Area Shape file (for the selected study area)](https://github.com/dineth33/Trip-purpose-inference-framework/tree/main/Land%20area) </br> 

5. [Additional data (POI opening times/temporal impact for trip purposes)](https://github.com/dineth33/Trip-purpose-inference-framework/tree/main/Additional%20data)
